Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/jobbot.git
   cd jobbot
   ```

2. Configure Credentials and Preferences
   Update the `JobApplicationStarter.java` file with your LinkedIn login and preferred job title/location.

   ```java
   String email = "your-email@example.com";
   String password = "your-password";
   String jobTitle = "Software Engineer";
   String location = "New York";
   ```



3. Fix Browser DevTools Warning (Optional)
   If you get warnings about CDP versions, add this to your dependencies:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
       <artifactId>selenium-devtools-v136</artifactId>
       <version>4.12.1</version>
   </dependency>
   ```
   Or match the version with your Chrome version.

AI Matching

Known Issues

- SLF4J warning: Safe to ignore, logging will fallback to NOP.
